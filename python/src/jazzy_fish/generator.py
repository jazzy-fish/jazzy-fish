Generator
=========

Contains the Generator class, which generates unique integer identifiers
that respect the configured settings and can be later converted to [word sequences] with a WordEncoder.

Classes:
    Generator - Generates unique integer identifiers with configurable properties. It is formed by three parts (time unit, machine id, sequence).
    GeneratorException - Raised when a Generator is misconfigured.
    Resolution - Used to specify the time unit of the generated identifiers.
    ThreadSafeGenerator - Deprecated alias for Generator, which is thread safe on its own.

class Resolution(Enum):

    The time resolution used by the generator determines how many IDs can be generated per the configured time unit.
    A higher resolution (i.e., milliseconds) results in a higher generation throughput but a faster exhaustion of the solution space.
    A lower resolution (i.e., minutes) results in IDs being able to be generated for a longer period, at the expense of rare generation options.
    Generally, do not use minutes unless certain that the generator will be seldomly called, or if specifying sufficient sequence_bits.
