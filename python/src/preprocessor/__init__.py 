Preprocessor
============

This package contains code that can process input wordlists and generate input word list combinations for the jazzy-fish library,
which can be inspected to help users infer the best choice depending on use-case.

Modules:
    clean_dictionary - Given a dictionary as an input directory, clean every list of word parts by removing invalid, non ASCII, non alpha words,
                       and inappropriate words (as defined by the `ignored.txt` list).
    generate_words - Generates combinations of word parts of varied prefix lengths to help the user choose the best configuration
                     for their use-case.
    helpers - Various helper functions and preprocessor settings, which can be tuned (if needed).
